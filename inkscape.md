Copy both **textext.py** and **textext.py** in the extention folder 

* **Linux**

Extension folder is
``` 
~/.config/inkscape/extensions/ or /usr/share/inkscape/extensions

```
under linux the left one is for a local user and the right one for all users.


One also needs the packages *texlive pstoedit pdf2svg*
``` 
$ sudo apt-get install texlive pstoedit pdf2svg

```

* **MacOSX**

Extension folder is
``` 
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions

```

You also need to install **pstoediitt** through Macport or Fink.
